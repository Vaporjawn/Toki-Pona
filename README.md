## What is Toki Pona?

Toki Pona is a constructed language (conlang) created by Canadian linguist and translator Sonja Elen Kisa in 2001. The name "Toki Pona" means "good language" or "simple language" in the language itself. The goal of Toki Pona is to create a minimal and easy-to-learn language that can express a wide range of ideas using a small vocabulary and simple grammar.

Toki Pona has around 120 to 137 root words, depending on the version, and it uses a subject-verb-object sentence structure. The language is designed to encourage clear and concise communication. Despite its small vocabulary, Toki Pona speakers can combine words and use contextual understanding to convey more complex concepts.
