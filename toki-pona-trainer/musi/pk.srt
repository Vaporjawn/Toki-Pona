==god said take it and situate it in a grand new
holy temple because its presence..

==the thief who stole my remote is caught.

==lets take thief to tapasvi ji, and ask him
to return remote otherwise we will reveal the truth
by theif on television.

1017
01:56:45,956 --> 01:56:49,019
tapasvi ji didn't find my remote in himalaya.

1018
01:56:49,114 --> 01:56:51,353
that means he is lying.

1019
01:56:54,177 --> 01:56:59,080
that means wrong number is spread by
tapasvi ji not duplicate god

1020
01:57:01,479 --> 01:57:03,955
did you know about that?

1021
01:57:04,177 --> 01:57:07,701
pk, remember the first time you
talked about wrong number?

1022
01:57:07,701 --> 01:57:12,717
whoever is trying to reach god, tapasvi ji
is dialing wrong number for them.

1023
01:57:12,717 --> 01:57:15,834
i knew in a second that you were
not doing it right.

1024
01:57:15,834 --> 01:57:21,231
but i didn't clear your confusion.
because if you call tapasvi ji fraud
his follower would've beaten you.

1025
01:57:21,231 --> 01:57:23,707
people needed an creative
solution.

1026
01:57:23,707 --> 01:57:25,342
hold on. that's wrong number.

1027
01:57:25,342 --> 01:57:28,183
and your examples with wrong number
really pulled mass attention.

1028
01:57:28,342 --> 01:57:30,834
today they are all supporting you.
- its a wrong number.

1029

1038

waste her time with me.

1039
01:58:22,284 --> 01:58:24,268

1040

why don't you suggest me some name.
whichever you like.

1047
01:58:51,762 --> 01:58:58,065
you see name and personality should match.

1048
01:58:58,112 --> 01:59:03,063
absolutely. so how is my personality?

1049
01:59:03,525 --> 01:59:06,930

1052
01:59:27,239 --> 01:59:35,762

one terrorist group was resposible for this attack

1072
02:03:45,933 --> 02:03:51,930
..they said it was only an example.
nobody can mess up with our religion.

1073
02:03:52,677 --> 02:03:56,146

give me ..

1080
02:05:05,225 --> 02:05:06,109
what is this?

1081
02:05:07,427 --> 02:05:12,328
what is this, god says this is his.

1082
02:05:12,407 --> 02:05:16,120
but he says it's his property.

1083
02:05:16,911 --> 02:05:24,623
God says contruct temple,
but he obstructs.

1084
02:05:24,859 --> 02:05:29,810
now who shall we follow?
GOD or him?

1085
02:05:30,276 --> 02:05:33,949
he was wearing yellow helmet 
and distributing this..

1086

have a look

1087
02:05:36,796 --> 02:05:43,225
first he stated God is missing,
later called him fraud.

1088
02:05:43,403 --> 02:05:46,419
tomorrow he might say
god is dead.

1089
02:05:48,086 --> 02:05:49,951
son, what are you upto?

1090
02:05:50,903 --> 02:05:54,177
..a world where god doesn't exist?

1091
02:05:56,384 --> 02:06:01,027
Do you have a clue about common people's
pain.

1092
02:06:01,205 --> 02:06:02,906
..there is no food to eat

1093
02:06:03,705 --> 02:06:06,146
no house to live.

1094
02:06:06,959 --> 02:06:13,709
no friends to talk..
many commit suicide everyday

1095
02:06:14,142 --> 02:06:17,203
cut their wrist,
hang themselves on ceiling.

1096
02:06:17,416 --> 02:06:20,915
..because they don't have hope.

1097
02:06:21,708 --> 02:06:23,466
if worshing god..

1098
02:06:24,843 --> 02:06:32,559
..following customs and praying gives them hope

1099
02:06:32,559 --> 02:06:36,343
then who are you to take
their hope away?

1100
02:06:37,097 --> 02:06:37,970
and if..

1101
02:06:38,744 --> 02:06:45,850
..you really want to detach people from god,
then tell us what would you give us in return?

1102
02:06:46,434 --> 02:06:49,569
enough of these "wrong number" allegations.

1103
02:06:50,780 --> 02:06:55,995
instead tell us today what exactly is the
right number.

1104
02:07:04,607 --> 02:07:07,067
you are right

1105
02:07:08,258 --> 02:07:13,179
once even i didn't have food to eat..

1106
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:15,778
no place to live

1107
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:18,258
i used to cry a lot

1108
02:07:19,329 --> 02:07:22,026
..as i didn't have any friends
either.

1109
02:07:23,515 --> 02:07:26,094
that time i only had one support

1110
02:07:28,614 --> 02:07:30,003
..God.

1111
02:07:31,610 --> 02:07:37,404
every morning felt like tomorrow
will be less worse, god will do something.

1112
02:07:39,797 --> 02:07:40,297
i agree..

1113
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:47,339
that believing in god gives hope.

1114
02:07:48,150 --> 02:07:52,309
..gets strength to cope with pain.

1115
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:57,379
but i have a question.

1116
02:07:58,638 --> 02:08:00,463
which god to trust?

1117
02:08:02,547 --> 02:08:05,067
you say god is one.

1118
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:07,974
i say wrong..

1119
02:08:09,701 --> 02:08:10,994
there are two gods.

1120
02:08:12,657 --> 02:08:14,304
one who created us

1121
02:08:16,745 --> 02:08:19,542
..and second whom you created.

1122
02:08:21,585 --> 02:08:24,642
i don't know anything about the one
who created us.

1123
02:08:25,098 --> 02:08:26,804
but the one you created..

1124
02:08:27,062 --> 02:08:30,304
is exactly like you.

1125
02:08:30,369 --> 02:08:34,555
small, liar, corrupted, makes false
promises.

1126
02:08:34,932 --> 02:08:38,960
he meets rich quickly,
and makes poor wait in queue.

1127
02:08:39,139 --> 02:08:41,044
gets happy when appreciated.

1128
02:08:41,143 --> 02:08:43,456
frighten people over small things.

1129
02:08:44,607 --> 02:08:46,472
I have a simple point.

1130
02:08:48,437 --> 02:08:53,080
trust god who created us.

1131
02:08:54,806 --> 02:08:59,659
and strike out the fake god you created.

1132
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,873
and you think we'll stay quiet?

1133
02:09:08,191 --> 02:09:11,980
Son, we know how to protect our god.

1134
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:13,449
you will protect god?

1135
02:09:15,495 --> 02:09:15,995
..you?

1136
02:09:16,763 --> 02:09:18,260
this planet very small

1137
02:09:18,946 --> 02:09:22,143
million bigger planets are out there in
space.

1138
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:29,003
and you are sitting in that small planet,
in small city, in small room, talks about protecting god?

1139
02:09:29,144 --> 02:09:31,593
the one who created this whole life?

1140
02:09:31,803 --> 02:09:33,980
he doesn't need your protection.

1141
02:09:34,878 --> 02:09:37,123
he can protect himself real good.

1142
02:09:39,766 --> 02:09:45,824
today somebody tried to protect their god 
and my friend died.

1143
02:09:46,432 --> 02:09:48,635
only this shoe is left.

1144
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:56,134
stop protecting the god, or else in
this planet only shoes will be left, no humans.

1145
02:09:56,591 --> 02:09:58,156
one muslim blows a bomb

1146
02:09:59,242 --> 02:10:03,990
and one hindu guru is listening your lecture.

1147
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:04,940
nice.

1148
02:10:05,472 --> 02:10:11,020
where is the stamp to prove that you
are hindu and i am muslim?

1149
02:10:11,861 --> 02:10:14,446
this difference is created by mankind.

1150
02:10:14,849 --> 02:10:20,841
and that itself is the most dangerous wrong number
of this planet.

1151
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:24,472
due to this people die.

1152
02:10:24,571 --> 02:10:29,333
the same wrong number you struck in jaggu's
brain and separated her from sarfaraz.

1153
02:10:29,909 --> 02:10:31,133
what wrong number?

1154
02:10:31,218 --> 02:10:33,055
that sarfaraz is dishonest.

1155
02:10:33,193 --> 02:10:35,642
you told that muslims are dishonest.

1156
02:10:35,745 --> 02:10:38,800
so he cheated. where's the lie?

1157
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:41,809
one second.
-no hang on. what is going on?

1158
02:10:42,173 --> 02:10:43,466
hang on one moment.

1159
02:10:43,959 --> 02:10:52,361
so you are telling me that my prediction was 
wrong?

1160
02:10:52,403 --> 02:10:53,594
duh, ofcourse.

1161
02:10:53,594 --> 02:10:54,646
then prove it.

1162
02:10:54,745 --> 02:10:59,586
prove it that my prediction was wrong.
and if you couldn't..

1163
02:10:59,963 --> 02:11:07,020

2. biggest confusion here is language.

1323
02:26:20,043 --> 02:26:24,687
if you hear in market that i'd like
 chicken/fish.

1324
02:26:24,746 --> 02:26:27,933
that doesn't mean they love animals.

1325
02:26:27,992 --> 02:26:32,397
it means they'll eat them for lunch today.

1326
02:26:32,476 --> 02:26:37,813
we will research why there is a difference
 in what they speak and think.

1327
02:26:37,952 --> 02:26:41,631
3. we'll steal cloths from the dancing car
right after landing.

1328
02:26:41,694 --> 02:26:44,789
then please insert your remote in your
underwear.

1329
02:26:44,849 --> 02:26:49,099
..really really deep inside.
don't want anyone to steal.

1330
02:26:49,234 --> 02:26:57,066
and 4. most importantly if you meet someone
who says he can help you contacting God.

1331
02:26:57,150 --> 02:27:03,427
..then to hell with research. just take a U-turn
and run for your life in full speed.

1332
02:27:14,657 --> 02:27:16,834
come bro, don't be scared. come.

1333
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:24,014
what for you gazing? eh?

1334
02:27:25,105 --> 02:27:26,653
I have a question.

1335
02:27:27,227 --> 02:27:28,061
what?

1336
02:27:28,696 --> 02:27:34,089
last time how many times you
got beaten up?

1337
02:27:41,537 --> 02:27:42,708
what's that for?

1338
02:27:42,748 --> 02:27:43,978
self defense.

1339
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:46,708
aha, safety!

1340
02:27:46,946 --> 02:27:48,579
let's go
-yes let's go.

1341
02:27:48,692 --> 02:27:51,628
not that direction.
this direction...

1342
02:27:51,740 --> 02:27:54,121
